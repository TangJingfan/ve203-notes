## Introduction

Welcome to VE203, aka Discrete Mathematics. In this semester, we are going to have a glance at (1) Basic Set Theory and Applications, (2) Counting and Algorithms, (3) Basic Group Theory and its application. Topics are not only interesting but also a little bit abstract. I hope you can enjoy this semester through trials and errors.

This repo includes TA materials. Most of the files will be stored in Markdown file. PDF files will be uploaded to Canvas. Everything in this repo is copyright-free. I hope it can benfit as many as it can be.
