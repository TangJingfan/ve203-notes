# VE203 rc0

Again, welcome to VE203. This is one of my favourate courses at Joint Institute. I hope we can share the same feeling at the end of semester. In rc0, I will lead to browse all topics covered in this course and give you some tips on how to grasp the essence of this course.

## Basic Set Theory and Logic

The content in this section connects the `set` we have learned in high school with more interesting properties. A graph is shown below.

```mermaid
    graph
    A(["Set"])
    B(["Multiset"])
    C(["Set Notation"])
    D(["Set Operation"])
    E(["Set Algebra"])
    F(["Cartesian Product"])
    G(["Simple Graph"])
    H(["Directed Graph"])
    A <--> B
    A --> C
    A --> D
    C --> E
    D --> E
    D --> F
    AA(["Proposition"])
    AB(["Connectives"])
    AC(["Boolean Algebra"])
    AA <--> A
    AA --> AB
    AB <--> D
    AA --> AC
    AB --> AC
    E <--> AC
    AD(["Truth Tree"])
    AE(["Natural Deduction"])
    AC --> AD
    AC --> AE
    G <--> H
    AF(["Predicate"])
    AG(["Quantifier"])
    AF --> AA
    AG --> AA
```

## Induction and Recursion

Many things in this world are not chaotic; rather, there exist some hidden rules. Induction and Recursion employ these rules to find some properties.

```mermaid
    graph
    A(["Induction"])
    B(["Complete Induction"])
    C(["Recursive Definition"])
    D(["Structural Induction"])
    E(["Mathcmatical String"])
    F(["Proof"])
    G(["Monoid"])
    H(["WOP"])
    A ---> B
    A ---> D
    C --> D
    C --> E
    E --> D
    A --> F
    B --> F
    D --> F
    G --> E
    H --> F
```

## Relation, Function and Order

These are important topics in this course. We are discussing interesting relations between numbers, functions and exploring order of things.

```mermaid
    graph
    A(["Relation"])
    B(["Function"])
    C(["Domain and Codomain"])
    D(["Partial Function"])
    E(["Operation"])
    F(["Injection and Surjection"])
    G(["Properties of Relation"])
    H(["Equivalence Class"])
    I(["Partition"])
    J(["Quotient Set"])
    K(["Monoid Homomorphism"])
    A --> B
    B --> C
    A --> D
    A --> E
    B --> F
    A --> G
    G --> H
    G --> I
    I --> J
    H --> J
    J --> K
```

## Numbers and Equinumerosity

We will explore how people find new numbers.

```mermaid
    graph
    A(["Expansion"])
    B(["Equinumerosity"])
    C(["Cantor's Theorem"])
    D(["Dominance"])
    E(["Cantor-SchrÃ¶der-Bernstein Theorem"])
    A --> B
    B --> C
    B --> D
    B --> E
    D --> E
```
