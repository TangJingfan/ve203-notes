# VE203 rc1

> In rc1, we will go over basic set theory and operation. Further, we will learn proposition, truth tree and natural dedcution. This rc should not be so hard but problems sometimes can be difficult to handle. I hope you can master them.

## Set

Definition: A set is an **unordered** collection of distinct objects, called **elements** or members of the set.

- $a \in A$ means a belongs to A
- $a \notin A$ means a not belongs to A

---

Then we comes to a special concept.

## Multiset

Definition: A multiset does allow repeated objects.

This concept is not so important but may be tested.

---

How many elements are there in a set; this is always an interesting question. Here we introduce **Cardinality**.

## Cardinality

Definition: The **size** of a set A is called its cardinality, denoted by $|A|$, $ \# A$, or $card\,A$.

- $|A| \in \mathbb{N} $ if A is a finite set;
- $|A| = \infty$ otherwise.

---

Above are easy concepts. All you need is to recite. Here comes the first important part: Set operation.

## Set operation

There are **four** common operations: union, interesction, difference, symmetric difference.
