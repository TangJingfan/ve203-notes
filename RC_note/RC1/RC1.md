# VE203 RC1

> In RC1, we will go over logic, proposition, boolean algebra, truth tree and natural deduction. There are important and must be tested in mid-term exam.

## Proposition

Basic and foundamental concept in this chapter. 

**Definition**: A proposition or statement is a declarative sentence that is either true or false, but not both.

As a result, the combination of quantifier and predicate forms a proposition.

### Connectives

$\land \   \text{,} \ \lor \text{,} \ \lnot \ \text{,} \to \ \text{,} \ \leftrightarrow $

Here **notation**, **priority** and **Truth Table** are very important, especially for $\to$.

### Priority

If you don't remember these well, you may be lost when you see a complicated predicate.

$ ( \ \ \ ) > \neg > \land >  \lor > \ \to \ > \ \leftrightarrow $

## Simple Boolean Algebra

You don't have to master them, and you may not meet them in exams. But we have to mention them.

**Tautology**: all cases lead to 1.

**Contradiciton**: all cases lead to 0.

**Equivalence**: $p$ and $q$ are equivalent if $p \leftrightarrow q$ is a tautology. Denoted by $p \Leftrightarrow q$.

**Formal Implication**: We say that $p$ formally implies $q$ if $p \to q$ is a tautology, denoted by
$p \Rightarrow q$.

We use tautology equivalence (as shown in slides) to simplify and further to prove some unapparent equivalence.

Eg. $ p \to q \Leftrightarrow \neg q \to \neg p \Leftrightarrow \neg p \lor q$

## Truth Tree
