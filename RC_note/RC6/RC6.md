> Congrats! We finally reach the end of the semester. This is the final recitation class and I will provide a checklist for you.

## Linear Recurrence Relation

- How to solve a linear Recurrence Relation?
    - Please use Formal Power Series and Generating Function.
    - Properly set Formal Power Series.
    - Use partial fraction to make calculation easier.

## Formal Power Series

- How to perform calculation?
    - Review slides.
    - Do remember those properties well.

- How to find inverse power series?
    - \(a_0 \neq 0\)
    - Use geometric series. 

## Binomial Theorem

- Why we learn Binomial Theorem?
    - When we use formal power series to solve counting problems, we intend to find the coefficient of certain terms. Binomial Theorem helps us to find those terms.

- What should we remember?
    - Four identities.
    - Definition of \(\binom{m}{k}\).

## Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion

- What is PIE?

- How to use PIE in counting problems?
    - Derangement.
    - Counting Surjection.

## Asymptotic Notations

- What do different symbols mean?

## Master Theorem

- How to use Master Theorem?
    - First judge the relationship between coefficients. 
    - Then choose appropriate formula.

## Number Theorey

- How to show there exist infinitely many primes which are of certain term?
