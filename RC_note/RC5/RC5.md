## Divisibility

**Definition:** Let \( n, d \in \mathbb{Z} \) with \( d \neq 0 \). We say that \( d \) divides \( n \), denoted by \( d \mid n \), if \( n = dk \), for some \( k \in \mathbb{Z} \), i.e.,

\[
d \mid n \iff (\exists k \in \mathbb{Z})(n = dk)
\]

By convention, \( 0 \mid n \) only if \( n = 0 \).

### Equivalent Statements

- \( d \) divides \( n \).
- \( n \) is divisible by \( d \).
- \( n \) is a multiple of \( d \).
- \( d \) is a divisor of \( n \).
- \( d \) is a factor of \( n \).

## Non-divisibility

If \( d \) does not divide \( n \), we write \( d \nmid n \). In other words:

\[
d \nmid n \iff \frac{n}{d} \notin \mathbb{Z}
\]

### Examples

1. \( n \mid 0 \) for all \( n \in \mathbb{Z} \).
2. \( 1 \mid n \) for all \( n \in \mathbb{Z} \).
3. If \( d \in \mathbb{Z} \), then \( d \mid 1 \implies d = \pm 1 \).
