> In this recitation class, we will breifly go over important content in logic, induction, algebra structure, and equinumerosity. In addition, we will review basic concept of pigeonhole principle, relation and partial order. After illustration of concept, exercise will be provided for you to get prepared for mid-term exam. Good luck!

## Logic

You must be very familiar with basic concept like logic operator, propostion, etc. We will omit these things in Recitation class. If you are not familiar with them, please review slides carefully!
